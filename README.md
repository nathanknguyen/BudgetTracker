# BudgetTracker

## About
This progressive web application is a budget tracker that uses MongoDB to store data and allows the user the track their expenses online or offline and automatically updates when the user reconnects to the internet.

The motivation and toughest part about this project was the online/offline functionality, allowing the user to record new data while offline, then automatically update the database when the user returns online.

Technologies Used: MongoDB, HTML 5, CSS, Javascript
